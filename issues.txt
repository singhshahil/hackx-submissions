First, we must acquire one photograph of each student and each student's name. We build and train the face recognition model using dlib and face_recognition API in Python. When a student is in live feed, our system detects his/her face and it recognises the student and shows a bounding box around the student's face with their name as label. And the student's name and time at which the student is present in live feed is also stores in a csv file named Attendance.\r\n## üî¶ Any other specific thing you want to highlight?\r\nThis system has great scope. It can be used in many fields other than as an attendance system. It can also be used for security checks, online invigilation systems etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\r\n\r\n**Before you post the issue**:\r\n- [ ] You have followed the issue title format.\r\n- [ ] You have provided all the information correctly.\r\n- [ ] You have read and agree with the terms in the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/scaleracademy/hackx-submissions/blob/main/coc.md)\r\n- [ ] Make sure you have filled this [Google Form](https://bit.ly/hackxprojectsubmisson)\r\n",

As it‚Äôs available in a single web page everyone is interested to open it. It uses not only childrens but also for Techies mainly on Funday Fridays. I know they are apps are available in market with the same idea but none of the application is as simple as i have designed and developed because it contains only browser understanding technologies so it is very fast to load. People are getting bored and frustrated to open a new app for every task that is the reasoning Booking.com, Justdial‚Ä¶ so many are coming up with an idea to make all them together. \r\nIn the same way, I developed all the games at one place that is nothing but GamHort.\r\n\r\nGamHort ‚áí Game + Cohort(collection of stars) but in our case collection of Games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¶ Any other specific thing you want to highlight?\r\n_(Optional)_\r\n\r\n\r\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\r\n\r\n**Before you post the issue**:\r\n- [X ] You have followed the issue title format.\r\n- [X] You have provided all the information correctly.\r\n- [X ] You have read and agree with the terms in the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/scaleracademy/hackx-submissions/blob/main/coc.md)\r\n- [X ] Make sure you have filled this [Google Form](https://bit.ly/hackxprojectsubmisson)\r\n",

Thus, this can record attendance and time of the user entrance, by matching the image captured in the video. This project not only applies to attendance management, but also can be applied in Hotel reservation system, where user gets registered to a room, where receptionist captures the image of the person. Then when the person enters the lift, the camera in the lift, recognizes the image of the person and thus automatically selects which floor he needs to go to. This software can also be used to allow authorized persons only in an restricted area, such as nuclear plants, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¶ Any other specific thing you want to highlight?\r\n_(Optional)_\r\n\r\n\r\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\r\n\r\n**Before you post the issue**:\r\n- [x] You have followed the issue title format.\r\n- [x] You have provided all the information correctly.\r\n- [x] You have read and agree with the terms in the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/scaleracademy/hackx-submissions/blob/main/coc.md)\r\n- [x] Make sure you have filled this [Google Form](https://bit.ly/hackxprojectsubmisson)\r\n",

Moreover, there are many people, who after their Covid Recovery, are willing to donate Covid Resources. The Idea of CoviCure revolves around solving this problem. CoviCure Community will bridge the gap between the people who are in dire need of help and the ones who are willing to donate.\r\nThe major Problems/Challenges CoviCure addresses are :\r\n1. It is quite difficult for the people who are in dire need of urgent Covid resources, to find verified leads and people who are willing to donate these resources, due to lack of communication and trust between them.\r\n2. Malpractices, scams and high-price quoting of life-saving resources such as Remdesivir, oxygen cylinders, vaccines etc.\r\n3. Unavailability of a fully-fledged one-stop webiste/application which performs real-time data fetching and updation.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Need of CoviCure? :\r\nTo Reduce the Time and Effort of the people in need of Emergency Services.\r\nTo Cater to the needs of the people in these harsh times of the pandemic.\r\nTo Impact a large section of the society through Technology.\r\nHow CoviCure Works? :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¶ Any other specific thing you want to highlight?\r\n_(Optional)_\r\n\r\n\r\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\r\n\r\n**Before you post the issue**:\r\n- [x] You have followed the issue title format.\r\n- [x] You have provided all the information correctly.\r\n- [x] You have read and agree with the terms in the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/scaleracademy/hackx-submissions/blob/main/coc.md)\r\n- [x] Make sure you have filled this [Google Form](https://bit.ly/hackxprojectsubmisson)\r\n",

    "body": "Zero Gravity - VMeet - Education\r\n\r\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project information\r\nA web application to help students and teachers for their easier management of classes.\r\nThe app includes authentications for both students and teachers where students would be able to join classes, look at the announcements in the classes and join the class meets, and teachers can create classes and make any announcements needed after logging in.\r\nThe application also includes joining a meet which is build using socket.io. \r\nBefore joining the meet the application prompts to capture an image of self with the help of a webcam where the image would be sent to the ML model which returns the clones score of the image taken and the image of the user residing in the database. \r\nIf the person present before the screen is same as the user then the attendance will be started for that user and he will be navigated to the meet page.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Your Theme** : Education \r\n2. **Project Name:** VMeet\r\n\r\n3. **Short Project Description:** In this project, we have made an web application that makes student-teacher interaction much easier along with the facility to join a meeting that records attendance using face recognition.\r\n\r\n4. **Team Name:** Zero Gravity\r\n\r\n5. **Team Members:** Thari Zephaniah - https://github.com/Zeph-T Somya Surendra Singh - https://github.com/tend2infinity M.Nithin Kumar Reddy - https://github.com/Nithin-Reddy-02 , Vishnu Agarwal - https://github.com/vishnuagbly\r\n\r\n6. **Demo Link:** https://youtu.be/JFIgEfwCtv4\r\n\r\n7. **Presentation Link:** https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fO79IKIiXOyzFL6LZkYLQKmOqyZ9Ox9jVj9QxmxGtXw/edit#slide=id.gf70debfe52_0_30\r\n\r\n8. **Repository Link:** https://github.com/Zeph-T/VMeet\r\n\r\n## üî• Your Pitch\r\nWe have created a classroom app, where we can do the following:\r\nBefore anything, you will be needed to create your account on our application.\r\nCreate Class: In our app, you can create your own class and share link/code with others who you want to join your class.\r\nJoin Class: One can join any class they have a link/code of. Once entering the class we ask the student to capture an image of him/her from his/her web camera. This will be stored in our database and will be later on used for attendance.\r\nPost Announcement: The creator of the class, the teacher, can post announcements too for the whole class, which will be visible to every student in the class.\r\nGet Attendance: For taking automatic attendance we will automatically capture an image from the webcam and check if the person on the webcam is the same person as the holder of the account. For this functionality, we are using MLModel to calculate the euclidean distance between two faces. For this first using cascade classifier we will be finding the location of the face in the image then, we will crop the faces from both images and then pass it through a FaceNet Model which will generate image embeddings for both faces, and then we will calculate Euclidean distance between both. Finally, the threshold of 0.7 is used to determine whether they are the same person or not.\r\nFor flexibility and scalability, we have then created a different mini API for this MLModel using Flask and then wrapped this whole API and Model using docker, to create a docker image. Now to deploy this image we have first created a container registry in AWS ECR then, created a container instance in AWS EC2, from there we deployed the model and were successfully able to create an HTTP-based REST API to interact with the model.\r\nOnce we have verified the student is the same person as the account holder, the student gets entry using Socket. Now, when the student exits, then his/her attendance and duration are recorded and stored in our database, to be accessed by the teacher.\r\n\r\nIn this way we were able to achieve auto-attendance using facial recognition, this application remarkably makes the whole attendance procedure completely effortless for the teachers and students.\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¶ Any other specific thing you want to highlight?\r\nThe ML model, that we have used for face recognition, is containerised and deployed on the AWS EC2 instance.\r\nThe deployed model takes two images as parameters and returns a closness score between them. Here‚Äôs the link of the model - http://ec2-18-188-117-109.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/distance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\r\n\r\n**Before you post the issue**:\r\n- [x] You have followed the issue title format.\r\n- [x] You have provided all the information correctly.\r\n- [x] You have read and agree with the terms in the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/scaleracademy/hackx-submissions/blob/main/coc.md)\r\n- [x] Make sure you have filled this [Google Form](https://bit.ly/hackxprojectsubmisson)\r\n",

And also as we know sometimes one has to wait more than enough in clinics until his chance comes. \r\nThis problem is regarding the issues faced by patients and doctors while waiting in clinic.\r\n1. Patients have to wait for more than enough time\r\n2. Doctors need to maintain hygiene and social distancing in their clinics\r\nOur Pitch:\r\nSo we have came up with an idea to make a app for patients and doctors to show how many patients are their in the queue. Their are be 2 phases of this app one for doctors and one for patients.\r\nPatients : one can easily book appointment of any specific doctor from their mobile itself and can check the status and go accordingly\r\nDoctors : This app will have the permission to book onfield appointments and can check the appointments of specific dates and update the queue according. This can be maintained by clinic owner or recieptionist.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üî¶ Any other specific thing you want to highlight?\r\n_(Optional)_\r\n\r\n\r\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\r\n\r\n**Before you post the issue**:\r\n- [x] You have followed the issue title format.\r\n- [x] You have provided all the information correctly.\r\n- [x] You have read and agree with the terms in the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/scaleracademy/hackx-submissions/blob/main/coc.md)\r\n- [x] Make sure you have filled this [Google Form](https://bit.ly/hackxprojectsubmisson)\r\n",

To prevent such atrocities from happening again, we bring you MediLife - An on demand paramedic facility which gives live tracking for your ambulance service and also to hospitals who can then make arrangements for the patients, thereby giving the doctors extra time to prepare for extraordinary cases.
